# Wreck Detect
## Summary
A deep learning image classifier using a convolutional neural network that can detect whether or not an image of a vehicle is damaged or wrecked. A model was created that had a binary prediction accuracy of about 89% and an AUC score of about 95%.

# Introduction
Deep learning has many applications and uses and can be a very powerful tool used to predict all sorts of things as well as assist with automation. However, this comes at the cost of interpretability of the model. Regardless, I think it is an amazing, complex field that is worth learning and understanding. This project is my attempt at learning all the tools necessary to build out a deep learning model that can classify an image of a car as having damage or not. 

# Steps
The first thing I needed to do was obtain a bunch of images of cars that are wrecked and cars that have no damage at all. I also needed to write a program to help me efficiently label the images. I also had to figure out how convolutional neural networks worked as well as how they are commonly architecured.
